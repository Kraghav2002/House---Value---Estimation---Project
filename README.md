# Real-Estate-Price-Estimation-Project

![](Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.PNG)

This data science project series explains how to create a real estate price prediction website step-by-step. We will first create a model using the Bangalore Home Prices dataset from Kaggle.com using linear regression. The next step would be to create a Python Flask server that processes http requests using the stored model. The third element is a website made using html, css, and javascript that asks the python flask server for the anticipated price once the user enters information about their home's square footage, bedrooms, etc. Nearly all data science techniques, including data loading and cleaning, outlier identification and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reductionÂ and k fold cross validation, will be covered throughout model development.


This project addresses, in terms of technology and tools,

1. __Python__ 
2. __Using Numpy and Pandas to clean data__
3. __Data visualisation software Matplotlib__
4. __Sklearn for model building__
5. __Using PyCharm as an IDE, Visual Studio Code, and Jupyter Notebook__
6. __Python flask for http server__
7. __UI using HTML/CSS/Javascript__
