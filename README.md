# House-Value-Estimation-Project

![House-Value-Estimation](https://github.com/Kraghav2002/House---Value---Estimation---Project/blob/main/House_Value_Estimation.png)


### This project series explains how to create a House Value Estimation website step-by-step. We will first create a model using the Bangalore Home Prices dataset from Kaggle.com using linear regression. The next step would be to create a Python Flask server that processes http requests using the stored model. The third element is a website made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that asks the Python Flask server for the anticipated price once the user enters information about their home's square footage, bedrooms, etc.

## Technologies and Tools Used

### This project addresses, in terms of technology and tools:

**Python**: We will be using Python as the primary programming language for this project.

**Data Cleaning**: We will use NumPy and Pandas to clean the real estate dataset and prepare it for analysis.

**Data Visualization**: We will use Matplotlib to create visualizations and gain insights from the data.

**Machine Learning**: We will use Scikit-Learn to build a linear regression model to predict real estate prices.

**Integrated Development Environments**: We will use PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Jupyter Notebook as IDEs.

**Web Development**: We will use Python Flask to build a web server, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interface for the real estate price prediction website.

**Project Structure**

## The project is divided into the following sections:

**Data Cleaning**: In this section, we will use NumPy and Pandas to clean and preprocess the real estate dataset.

**Data Visualization**: In this section, we will use Matplotlib to visualize the cleaned data and gain insights.

**Model Building**: In this section, we will use Scikit-Learn to build a linear regression model to predict real estate prices.

**Web Server**: In this section, we will use Python Flask to build a web server that serves the model.

**User Interface**: In this section, we will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interface for the real estate price prediction website.

## How to Run the Project

### To run the project, you will need to:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install the necessary dependencies.
* Run the Flask server.
* Open the website in your web browser.
